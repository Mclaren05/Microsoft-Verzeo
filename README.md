In addition to the specifications mentioned for making the project, we have added some additional features, namely, authentication or in other words, a sign-up/login system.

Instructions for running the project on local system:
Download the zipped file and unzip it to a location of your choice.
Navigate to the location of the folder on the terminal.
Run: "npm install" in the terminal. It will install all the required packages.
Open another tab in the terminal and run this command: "mongod" . It will start the database server. (Assuming that you already have a mongoDB database application on your system)
Go back to the tab where you ran npm install. Run this command in that tab: "nodemon app.js". This will start the server.  
Go to your default browser and type this in the search bar, "localhost:3000/", and run it.
Voila! Your website is running now.
Lastly create an account by signing up, using an email address and forming a password.
Finally, you will land on the homepage of the website where you can carry out all your crud operations, like create user, delete user, update user etc.
Then you can logout. Later on you can login using the same credentials you used for signing in.
